# ellipsestext
Implement More/less function in html
Below is the sample text. Each text is wrapped in a DIV tag. Note that we have added a class “more” in each div. This class will decide if a text needs to be shortened and show more link showed or not.
You can change the behaviour by changing following js variables.

showChar: Total characters to show to user. If the content is more then showChar, it will be split into two halves and first one will be showed to user.
ellipsestext: The text displayed before “more” link. Default is “…”
moretext: The text shown in more link. Default is “more”. You can change to “>>”
lesstext: The text shown in less link. Default is “less”. You can change to “<<"
